 * BK7258 AP JPEG decoder board helper.  NuttX has a generic V4L2 M2M
 * upper-half, but it has no JPEG decoder lower-half matching the BK7258
 * SDK's frame_buffer_t contract.  This interface is therefore a typed
 * board integration helper, not a character-device ABI.  A board media
 * owner may adapt it to V4L2 queue operations.

 * for table 0 and table 1; one valid baseline DHT each for DC0, DC1, AC0,
 * and AC1; Y using quantization/Huffman table 0; and Cb/Cr using table 1.
 * The scan component order must match SOF order.  The YUV400 value is
 * retained for source ABI compatibility but is never returned because the
 * hardware path rejects a one-component stream.  RGB, planar YUV, scaling,
 * rotation, progressive/multiscan JPEG, and custom table numbering are

 * compressed bytes into a grow-only, cache-line-aligned handle buffer with
 * the SDK's required zeroed read guard; successful uninitialize releases that
 * buffer.  It also performs input clean and output flush/invalidate operations
 * around the hardware transfer.  Input data is read only; decode updates input
 * width/height and output length/width/height on success.  Output is tightly
 * packed width * height * 2 byte YUYV with no configurable stride.  Its base
 * must be aligned to the active data-cache line size and its capacity must
 * cover the correspondingly rounded span.  When D-cache is disabled, as in
 * the maintained non-cacheable AP handoff, natural pointer alignment is used
 * instead.  The caller must own that complete rounded span exclusively for
 * the duration of decode.  Output length reports only the unrounded pixel
 * payload, is cleared before validation, and stays zero on every failure. */

 * are normal thread-context calls.  Deinitialize only after decode returns.
 * An SDK decode failure faults this handle and is returned as -EIO;
 * subsequent get_info/decode calls also return -EIO until the owner
 * uninitializes and creates a new instance.  If initialize itself fails and
 * SDK rollback cannot close/delete the unique handle, initialize returns a
 * non-NULL recovery-only handle through `out` together with its negative
 * status.  The caller must retain that handle and retry uninitialize until it
 * succeeds before creating another instance.  A later initialize also
 * returns the same recovery handle with -EIO if the original caller lost it.
