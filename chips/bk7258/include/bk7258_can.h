/*
 * Return the singleton AP CAN lower-half.  Board integration owns the
 * can_register() call and the device path.  A second owner is rejected with
 * -EBUSY; bk7258_can_uninitialize() must be called only after all NuttX CAN
 * file references have been closed.
 *
 * The v3.1.1.9 BK7258 bundle supplies one classic CAN controller.  This
 * adapter intentionally exposes standard 11-bit CAN 2.0 data frames only:
 * CAN-FD, extended identifiers, and remote frames are rejected because the
 * SDK software FIFO does not preserve enough per-frame metadata for those
 * NuttX contracts.  Loopback is controlled through the standard
 * CANIOC_{GET,SET}_CONNMODES ioctl and maps to the SDK's internal LBMI bit.
 *
 * The SDK fixes CAN0 to GPIO44 (TX), GPIO45 (RX), and GPIO46 (standby).
 * This private API does not alter pin mux or arbitrate those pins with other
 * selected functions; platform integration must select a non-conflicting
 * owner.
